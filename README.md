# Famous_People_In_The_World

This project analyses the data on 20 famous people selected at random from the fields of movies and music. 
To protect privacy and ensure ethical use, the project relies entirely on synthetic data/information that is artificially generated to look and behave like real-world data but does not represent any actual person.

This means:
- All movie and music data is fictional yet realistic.
- No personal or confidential information is used.
- Safe for public use, experimentation, and learning.
- Using this dataset, users can explore data analysis, visualization, and storytelling while working with a safe, privacy-friendly dataset about the entertainment world.

The goal of this project is to explore trends such as:

- Common genres among top actors and musicians
- Revenue Generated Individually and in categories
- Awards and recognitions across entertainment fields
